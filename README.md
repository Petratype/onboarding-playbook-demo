## DataOps Onboarding Playbook

This repository contains a structured onboarding playbook designed to introduce new team members to the tools, workflows, and standards used within a DataOps environment. It outlines development practices, project structure guidelines, daily routines, and foundational best practices that support reliable and scalable data operations.

The goal is to provide a clear, organized reference that supports consistency across projects and helps new contributors integrate smoothly.
